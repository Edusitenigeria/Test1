    <!-- So we discussed about the heading tag yesterday
        and some formatting tags too but we're are not done with the formatting tags, 
        there still others to look into

        Still under formattings tags
        Can you give me the tags we discussed yesterday, i've forgotten
        I'm joking but tell me
        * I mean't formatting tags
        Example:- <b></b>, <strong></strong>

        YES, Examples
        YES, 5
        Correct
        Correct
        Okay you mentioned 3
        Wonderful

        You're trying

        Okay let's look at some other formatting tags
        1. del tag --- It is  used in HTML to cross out a particular text on our web browser...You get??
        Okay
        2. Underline tag --- It is used in HTML to give a text a line beneath on the web browser...in short 
        it is written as <u> </u>
        
        3. Super Tag --- It is used in HTML to give a text power (ie. Raise to the power) 
        <sup>Content</sup>
        <h3>X<sup>2</sup></h3> 
        Now write the above line of code
        Inside the body, that space at line 10
        Are you done??



        *Let me tell you a short cut.. on your keyboard, click on shift + 1 and quickly press the Tab key...
        it generates the syntax automatically
        Did it work??
        There's a space in between the <body> and </body> Tag, That's where you get to write your code.

        *Don't worry, i'll show the result on my browser later, 
        or you could run yours at your side to see the result.

        4. Subscript Tag --- It is used in HTML to give a text a base word/number
         (ie. Below the text )
         <sub>COntent</sub>
         So write that similar code but replace the sup with sub
         <h3>Log<sub>10</sub></h3>
         The h3 can be interchanged with either of the headings tags ie h1-h6
         is the 10 below the Log. okay okay, Nicey!

         so as i was saying, the h3 tag can be interchanged with any, not a must you should h3

         5. insert tag --- It is used in HTML to insert a 
         line beneath the text or to 
         show that that text was inserted...
         In short <ins>Content</ins>
        
         6. small tag -- It is used in HTML to make a 
         text appear
         small on the web browser...
         <small>Content</small>

         That is all for formatting Tags
         can i see your results please...for those tags 
    YES
